# LeetCode

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Java. Each solution is accompanied by an explanation to help understand the approach and logic used.

## Introduction

I created this repository to keep track of my progress on LeetCode and to share my solutions with others who are also preparing for coding interviews or improving their problem-solving skills. Each solution is written in Java, my preferred programming language.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem categories, making it easy to navigate and find specific problems. Each problem has a Java file with the solution code and a Markdown file with the problem statement and a detailed explanation.

### Example Structure
